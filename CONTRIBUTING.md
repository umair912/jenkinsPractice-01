# Contributing to PactumJS

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We would love to hear ideas, feedback & questions

We use [Github Discussions](https://github.com/pactumjs/pactum/discussions) to receive feedback, discuss ideas & answer questions.

Do you want to contribute to the PactumJS upcoming features? We use [Github Projects](https://github.com/orgs/pactumjs/projects/1) to track the road map of this project. If something seems interesting, start a [discussion](https://github.com/pactumjs/pactum/discussions), we can give more details & create an issue for you to work. 


## Report bugs using [Github Issues](https://github.com/pactumjs/pactum/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue, it's that easy!


## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.


## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. This library strives to be **lightweight**. Changes should be as minimum as possible by never compromising on the quality of the features. If you need to add a new package as a dependency, please reach out to maintainers at [Github Discussions](https://github.com/pactumjs/pactum/discussions). 
4. If you've changed APIs, update the [documentation](https://github.com/pactumjs/pactumjs.github.io).
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!
